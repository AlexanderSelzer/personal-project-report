            <p>
              The pH scale represents the <em>acidity</em> or <em>alkalinity</em> of a substance.
              It is a measure of the potential of Hydrogen in a molecule,
              and represents a range between two limits, the values 0 and 14,
              categorizing a substance as either acidic, if lower than 7, alkaline,
              if higher than 7, or neutral, when at the middle value of 7.
            </p>
            <p>
              Values on the pH scale are logarithmic to the base of 10. Every value approaching the
              extremes is ten times more acidic than the previous.
              A pH-value of 4 is 100 times more acidic than a value of 6.

          <span class="text">
            <h3>Natural Factors</h3>
            <p>
              While strong changes in pH are often human-caused, the acidity or alkalinity of
              environments can vary in numerous natural ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Large forests of trees, especially pine trees, cause an increase in the acidity
              of their environment, as leaves or needles drop.
              Decomposing needles release acids into their environment,
              and falling leaves lower the pH of water when decomposing.
              <br />
              Natural precipitation is slightly acidic, measuring between the pH values of 5 and 6, due to
              Carbonic Acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) formed from from Carbon Dioxide being dissolved.
              <br />
              Calcium Carbonate in the ground assists in keeping the pH close to 7 by combining with the Hydrogen atoms
              and neutralizing it.
              <br />
              In the rarer events of volcanic erruptions, the acidity of water can be increased significantly.  
            </p>
            <h3>Human Factors</h3>
            <p>
              Human Actions have the potential to greatly disturb the pH balance, which persists in nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Open Mining</em> can be seen as a great acceleration of erosion. This type of erosion
              releases minerals into the ground water at much higher rates than they would be in
              nature. The minerals are often highly soluble and strongly alkaline or acidic,
              affecting the pH.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Acid Rain</em>, caused mainly by the release of Sulphur Dioxide (SO<sub>4</sub>)
              and Nitrogen Oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>),
              due to the burning of coal, can increase the acidity
              of ground water and lakes significantly.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Direct Industrial Polution</em> through the dumping of polluting substances left over by the industry
              can very strongly affect the pH value.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Industrial Agriculture</em> utilizing fertilizers can release acidic substances into the water.

          <span class="title">The effects of pH on the ecosystem</span>
          <span class="text">
            <h3>Environmental Effects</h3>
            <p>
              The pH value of the ground water and lake/river water has a very strong effect
              on the ecosystem surrounding it and being contained in it.
            </p>
            <p>
              pH affects the solubility of substances in water, and with it the amount of nutrients that
              can be used by the organsims living in it. The toxicity of dangerous substances such as heavy metals
              is increased further, as the acidity increases, poisoning them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most species are only surviving effectively when suppied with water at a pH near to
              the most neutral values, around pH 7, while they maintain a specific tolerance for values
              slightly lower or higher.
              <br />
              Ground water is usually slightly alkaline or acidic, and animals can tolerate this, however, too strong
              values moving in both directions will damage life in the water.
              <br />
              If species die, the food chain is interrupted, which will take other animals, wh√≠ch would not be affected
              directly, with them.
            </p>
            <div class="image">
              <span class="title">The pH Scale</span>
              <img src="/images/phlevels.png" class="img-responsive" title="pH levels and their impact">
            </div>
            <p>
              A pH range of 6 to 9 will be safe for most organisms living in the water, but algae, which is the base of the
              entire food chain, can only grow well within the range of pH 7.5 to pH 8.4.
              <br />
              When algae growth is damaged, the growth of all fish will be stop.
            </p>
            <p>
              As low-pH water flows through the earth, it releases Aluminium from it,
              which flows into the seas, being poisonous to the fish.
            </p>
            <h3>Economic Effects</h3>
            <p>
            When the amount of fish in lakes decreases due to a high or low pH, the fishing industry
            will be affected. The efficiency of applying fertilizer in farming is affected by the pH of water.
            Modifying the pH adds extra costs.
            </p>
            <p>
            Correctly managing waste might be a challenge at first, but in the long-term it will compensate, as the nature
            is not harmed so strongly, and a smaller amount of the budget has to be spent in restoring.
            </p>
            <p>
            During the industrial revolution it was coal that fueled the economy. Without coal, and polluting sources
            of energy causing acid rain, the whole world would not have been able to industrialzed so strongly,
            resulting in huge technological advancements and techniques of restoring ecosystems.

        <span class="title">Preventing pH imbalances in water</span>
        <span class="text">
          <h3>Government Initiative</h3>
          <p>
            Strict government regulations have been applied to stop the degradation of natural sources of water, and to
            save species from going extinct.
          </p>
          <p>
            CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are controlled strongly, as a consequence of their strong links to the acceleration of
            global warming, which reduces the amount of acidity in rain, preventing water from being acidified.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is in most cases forbidden to simply dump industrious waste into bodies of water, or near places, from which it could
            end up in water. Recycling is recommended and supported by most governments.
          </p>
          <h3>Technological Progress</h3>
          <p>
            The chemical industries have strongly evolved in the last centuries, to provide means against polluting the environment
            with high or low pH.
            <br />
            It has been made possible to cheaply manufacture strong acids and alkalis, which can be used for neutralizing the
            waste products of the industry cost-efficiently.
            <br />
            In a case of strongly-polluted rivers or seas, chemicals can be used to correct the pH value and maintain the neutrality.

          <p>
            Water polution through an imbalance in pH can be a big problem for the ecosystem, which will eventually come
            back for the people to pay, which caused it with large hits against the environment.

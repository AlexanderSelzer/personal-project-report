## Reflection on Learning

### Extension of Knowledge

*``Reflect on how completing the prject has extended your knowledge and understanding of the topic and AoI``*

I have heavily extended my knowledge in web development while building the Branches Network.

While creating Branches I first encountered AngularJS, which I have by now used in other projects.
I started to learn very much about server-side JavaScript, I can use Express and other libraries much
more effectively now.
Besides, I also learned much about the core concepts of Node.js, e.g. Streams and Buffers.

Client-side work made me work much with CSS transformations, transitions, and animations, which are relatively
new concepts to me. I researched ways to animate SVG, and created many small tests, which I hope will help
make Branches even better.

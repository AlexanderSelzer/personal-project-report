### Organization and setup of the Infrastructure
*``How did I manage to set up the infrastructure? Step-by-step``*

I had already started with parts of the project in the Summer Holidays (2013).
They were not under Version Control.
In fact, I did not even know how to use git at the time.

This was before the project officially started, but I already knew what I would choose,
and busily planning the project.

The Branches Logo

We designed a logo for the Branches network and planned the layout.

After spending time on other projects, I came back to Branches. I understood git by then,
and had another server. A HP Proliant Server with 1TB RAID.

I set up a git server, Node.js, and Nginx on it, for use as a development server.

It was used like a central versioning system (yuck), and was somehow badly-configured.
This led to frustration, but it was due to my lack of knowledge in configuring the parts
of the server at the time, and my low experience with Git.

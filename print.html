<h3 id="choice-of-topic">Choice of Topic</h3>
<p>The chosen topic of interest is <em>social networking and web technoligies</em>.</p>
<p>branches.io, the main product is a social network, explaining the topic of social networking.
It uses parts of the traditional concepts of social networking used by big
social networks, and combines them with new ideas and lesser-known ideas.</p>
<p>The application is built on top of very modern frontend and backend web technologies utilizing
modern standards of the browser while maintaining necessary backwards-compability
and flexibility to meet the demands of all clients.
The API and web application is powered by a Node.js backend with a flexible and
fast MongoDB database.</p>

<h3 id="areas-of-interaction">Areas of Interaction</h3>
<p>The project is fully centered around creation of services, which enable clients the
creation of content.
This fits the area of interaction <em>Human Ingenuity</em> very strongly.</p>
<p>The Branches Network also has features of <em>Health and Social Interaction</em>,
by focusing on the users&#39; interactions, however, needing to focus on one, I believe that
<em>Human Ingenuity</em> is the better fit.</p>
<h3 id="the-goal">The Goal</h3>
<p>At the beginning, my goal was defined as</p>
<p><em>Create a successful and reliable Social Network on self-setup server infrastructure with the potential of making advertising profits.</em></p>

<p>The original specifications were defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Successfully set up a development server at my home.</li>
<li>Set up a product blog, at which the team shares progress with the users.</li>
<li>Successfully use the MongoDB server as the data-storage backend for the project.</li>
<li>Set up and configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for the Node.js instances.</li>
<li>Use Amazon EC2 and other AWS services to host Branches cost-effectively.</li>
<li>Establish a strong social media presence for the product and use social media effectively for promotion.</li>

<h3 id="evaluation-of-sources">Evaluation of Sources</h3>
<p>Several sources have been standing out in usefulness to my project.
They are evaluated to a special extent, as I have spent the most time looking
at information in them.</p>
<h4 id="stackoverflow-and-the-stack-exchange-network">Stackoverflow and the Stack Exchange network</h4>
<p>Stackoverflow the biggest Question and Answer forum of the topic of programming.
It is well respected by many programming communities for its high-quality content.</p>
<p>For me, it has answered many questions about JavaScript, Node.js, and other technologies
quickly.</p>
<h4 id="the-mozilla-developer-network">The Mozilla Developer Network</h4>
<p>The MDN is a collaboratively created collection of pages (a wiki) about the topic of Web Development.
It includes many useful articles about JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other web technologies.</p>
<p>The fact that is is collaboratively managed by a large community makes it reliable.</p>
<h4 id="the-node-js-reference">The Node.js Reference</h4>
<p>The official documentation of Node.js has proven to be very useful to my project.
It documents the core APIs of Node.js.</p>
<p>The Node.js docs are a rendered version of the markdown files in the GitHub repository,
which makes them reliable, as anyone can submit a pull request, which will be reviewed.</p>
            </div>
           <hr> 
          </section>
        
          <section class="page">
            <div class="container">
              
<h4 id="the-angularjs-reference">The AngularJS Reference</h4>
<p>AngularJS is the powerful framework powering the Branches frontend.</p>
<p>It is a very well-organized framework, which is a major player in frameworks for 
web applications (like Backbone, Ember, React).</p>
<p>The API documentation is very extensive, well-written, and also well-designed.
Angular also has a useful guide, which helped me get started quickly a few months ago.</p>
<p>As the documentation is very frequently accessed, and managed by the community, it is reliable,</p>
<h4 id="the-express-reference">The Express Reference</h4>
<p>Express is the Node.js web framework, on which Branches is built. It is lightweight (compared to 
Rails and similar), but its features make creating web applications in Node.js possible faster by
minimizing reinvention of features. It is based on Connect (version 3, 4 not anymore, but compatible),
a middleware-layer, which makes it compatible with many extensions, e.g. cookie sessins, Redis storage,
static file development servers, templating needed for web apps.</p>
<p>I am not sure who manages the Express documentation, but it has been very reliable. The fact that Express
is a small, lightweight and well-organized framework makes it very simple to look at the source directly
and not use the documentation.</p>
<h4 id="the-mongoose-reference">The Mongoose Reference</h4>
<p>The Model layer of Branches is based on Mongoose.
It provides a very intuitive way of creating data models, which is superior
to the badly-documented and complex MongoDB module.</p>
<p>The documentation is very helpful and well-organized. It provides effective examples,
and it is hosted in the project&#39;s GitHub repository, allowing everyone to contribute, and making
it reliable.</p>

<h4 id="version-control">Version Control</h4>
<p>I had already started with parts of the project in the Summer Holidays (2013).
They were not under Version Control.
In fact, I did not even know how to use git at the time.</p>
<p>This was before the project officially started, but I already knew what I would choose,
and busily planning the project.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aselzer/Branches_Logo.png" alt="">

<p>We designed a logo for the Branches network and planned the layout.</p>

          <section class="page">
            <div class="container">
              
<p>After spending time on other projects, I came back to Branches. I understood git by then,
and had another server. A HP Proliant Server with 1TB RAID.</p>
<p>I set up a git server, Node.js, and Nginx on it, for use as a development server.</p>
<p>It was used like a central versioning system (yuck), and was somehow badly-configured.
This led to frustration, but it was due to my lack of knowledge in configuring the parts
of the server at the time, and my low experience with Git.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aselzer/branches-server.JPG" alt="">

          <section class="page">
            <div class="container">
              
<p>I had always established a SSH session to the development server, in which I worked on Branches.
Besides that, a SSH tunnel forwarded the port of the development server.</p>
<p>This soon became problematic. Now it is hard to believe that I ever set up everything so inconveniently.
I like working in the train, in school, and everywhere, but to do this I needed an internet connection
to reach my server at home. The phone, which was used as a router started overheating, and the battery
was empty quickly. Also, the connection dropped frequently, which was plainly annoying.</p>
<p>The solution to this was to simply use Git as what it was meant to be. As a Decentralized Versioning System,
not a centralized one.</p>

            <div class="container">
              
<p>I started using Git normally, and the configuration of the server started to improve.</p>
<p>Soon something else was about to change. I started to really appreciate GitHub, and its services.
It was much more comfortable to host a private GitHub repository than to host the own server. Also,
it is more robust, as I am depending on the connection of my ISP. Download speed is much faster too.</p>
<p>Then I upgraded my account to be able to host 5 private repositories.
I created a GitHub organization for Branches, which would also be used to host the open-source
parts of the application, and the public libraries for connecting to it.</p>
<p>This again greatly improved the workflow.</p>

<h4 id="the-application">The Application</h4>
<p>From the beginning on I attempted to take care of organizing Branches well, but it took two rewrites
for the structure to finally work well.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the application did not follow any guidelines for structure. While it certainly was
not entirely badly-structured for a small application, it soon started to become a problem. It turned out that I
took modularity to its extremes (creating an over-modular app). Also, I misunderstood npm modules. Everything was
a module from the start.</p>
<p>It turned out that this was not a good strategy, although it was carefully planned.</p>
<p>After I did not work on Branches for almost one month, and came back to it after doing two smaller projects,
I realized how horrible my structure was. It was <em>too</em> carefully planned with placeholders everywhere, while actually
finding what I was looking for was very hard.</p>
<p>Determined to convert to a MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, I researched and found Sails.js.
It seemed to be the most active Node.js MVC Framework available, and Branches was immediately converted
to it. At the time, it was also moved to GitHub, so I decided to remove all history and start from scratch,
just taking what was needed.</p>
<p>Soon I realized Sails.js was not what I wanted. It tried to do too much, over which I wanted full control.
Sails partially controlls the client-side stack, which is something I do not want a server-side framework to do.
It modified template files in unpredictable ways, and included libraries. It started websocket servers, which I did
not want.</p>

Branches Organized</p>
<p>While Sails is a great framework for many, it did not fit into Branches, so I decided to rewrite it again.</p>
<p>Like before, I was again to use Express, but in a well-organized way, in a MVC Application.</p>
<p>A few days later it was done, and Branches was beautifully organized, even more organized than my other projects had been.</p>

<h4 id="testing">Testing</h4>
<p>When I started with Branches, I did not see the importance of testing. Features ended up broken easily.</p>
<p>However, after starting to use AngularJS, it became much clearer to me. I started using front-end tests.</p>
<p>Then, after rewriting as MVC Express, I started including Mocha tests.</p>
<p>Mocha is a very powerful testing framework. It supports many styles of testing, helpful reporters, and makes
testing both synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript easy.</p>

<p>One of the most important parts in implementing Branches was finding information for solving problems.
Luckily, this information is available in form of the sources referenced here.</p>
<p>Implementing something like Branches was a big and challenging task.
I worked on necessary administrative tasks beside the main project:</p>
<p><code>Note: Most information is not shown, as it would leak info about Branches, which has to yet fully launch</code></p>

<h3 id="the-aim">The Aim</h3>
<p>I did not clearly achieve the initial goal, because it was defined badly at
the beginning, and I would have changed it two to three months after initially
setting it.</p>
<p>The aim is not supposed to be changed after being written (on which I disagree).</p>
<p>It would have been possible to quickly finish Branches and push out some version of it now,
but this is not enough for me.</p>
<p>The goal was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a successful and reliable Social Network on self-setup server infrastructure with the potential of making advertising profits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is the <em>successful</em> part.</p>
<p>It is not &quot;successful&quot;, as it is not publicly released yet.</p>
<p>However, it is reliable in its testing environment. It runs on my self-setup server infrastructure
at home or on AWS, and even DigitalOcean if I wanted to.</p>
<p>I believe the product has a potential of making profits, but this part of the aim is especially ill-defined.
Advertising profits are not important to me now. I do not want them to be important.
All I want Branches to be is it being as great as I can make it be.</p>

<h3 id="the-project-specifications">The Project Specifications</h3>
<p>The original specifications were defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Successfully set up a development server at my home.</li>
<li>Set up a product blog, at which the team shares progress with the users.</li>
<li>Successfully use the MongoDB server as the data-storage backend for the project.</li>
<li>Set up and configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for the Node.js instances.</li>
<li>Use Amazon EC2 and other AWS services to host Branches cost-effectively.</li>
<li><p>Establish a strong social media presence for the product and use social media effectively for promotion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I successfully set up a development server at home, but later decided to test locally, and host on GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li>I set up a WordPress product blog, but I did not like the state of it, so I set up a Ghost blog, which is
much better to work with, faster, hackable, and more welcoming to developers.</li>
<li>MongoDB was successfully used as the main database, and is still being used very happily.</li>
<li>Nginx is obviously still the preferred web server and proxy for Branches, and I have learned very
much about its configuration.</li>
<li>I have used Amazon EC2 and the rest of the Amazon Cloud to host parts of Branches. However, AWS is not
the most cost-effective option for all of Branches&#39; problems. Backups are done much more inexpensively at home,
and DigitalOcean is a better solution for small-scale independent servers.</li>
<li>A social media presence has been established. Branches is present on Twitter, Facebook, and has its
own Product Blog.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="extension-of-knowledge">Extension of Knowledge</h3>
<p>I have heavily extended my knowledge in web development while building the Branches Network.</p>
<p>While creating Branches I first encountered AngularJS, which I have by now used in other projects.
I started to learn very much about server-side JavaScript, I can use Express and other libraries much
more effectively now.
Besides, I also learned much about the core concepts of Node.js, e.g. Streams and Buffers.</p>
<p>Client-side work made me work much with CSS transformations, transitions, and animations, which are relatively
new concepts to me. I researched ways to animate SVG, and created many small tests, which I hope will help
make Branches even better.</p>
<p>The project has greatly extended my knowledge in the topic of social networking, which is a subset of
the AoI Human Ingenuity.
Therefore it extendeded my knowledge in &quot;Human Ingenuity&quot; as well.</p>

<h3 id="development-as-a-learner">Development as a Learner</h3>
<p>This is ambiguous..</p>
<p>Definition of a &quot;learner&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a person who is still learning something</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/learner?q=learner">http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/learner?q=learner</a>)</p>
<p>&quot;Development as a learner&quot; means &quot;development as someone who is still learning something&quot;</p>
<p>I am someone who is still learning something, therefore I can shortcut the sentence:</p>
<p>&quot;Development as myself&quot;</p>
<p>Development is defined as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the process in which someone or something grows or changes and becomes more advanced</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a simple answer: I advanced my knowledge in very many topics, and gathered many skills,
which I did not have before (see &quot;Extension of Knowledge&quot;).</p>

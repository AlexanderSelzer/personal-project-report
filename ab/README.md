## My chemistry homework(-angularJS-site) using citationer.

This is my homework and was a small Bootstrap and
AngularJS test.

It uses my small but pretty helpful [Citationer](https://github.com/AlexanderSelzer/Citationer)
program to manage the references.

It is just so cool to type
`citationer -s http://localhost:8264`
and see the reference appear in the AngularJS app :)
(Possible waste-of-time-feature: Real-time citation using websockets)

## Running for testing

```JavaScript
$ npm install
$ cd app
$ bower install
$ gulp dev
# Look at localhost:8264
```
